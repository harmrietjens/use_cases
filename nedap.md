# Nedap Healthcare interests in Nuts

Since Nedap has applications in three different, it can, theoretically, evaluate the working of Nuts itself. It's, however, far more interesting to explore this with other parties.

## Nedap ONS - Helder
Nedap ONS is an EHR used by a variety of care providers in the elderly care, disabled care and mental health care. Last year a new application is developed for General Practitioners (GP's). It allows GP's to see the latest observations made by nurses in the elderly care. It also enables them to report back to the elderly care or ask questions. In order for the GP to see information from patients, consent from the patients is required. The decentralized consent records of Nuts are needed to facilitate this. GP's already use Irma to login to Helder.

As an added case it could be interesting to explore if a GP can register the consent himself.

## Nedap ONS - Caren zorgt
Nedap ONS is an EHR used by a variety of care providers in the elderly care, disabled care and mental health care. Caren is a PGO. As a first step the given Consent by the patient (through documents) should be visible in Caren.
